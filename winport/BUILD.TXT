Good luck building this!

You need to use MSVC .NET to use these given .sln files.

Other compilers will work just fine, but you'll have to set things up yourself.

You must first build the enummaker application from support/enummaker.

When it is built, run
enummaker source.txt
from the command line in the source root.

This will generate the glbdef.h and glbdef.cpp files you need.

Then, you can build using the solutions in this directory.
