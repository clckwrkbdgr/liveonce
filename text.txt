welcome::Timmy
    Welcome to You Only Live Once!  Hit '?' for a list of keyboard
    commands.

    The moutain-top village of Yamanote has had a peaceful existance
    for as long as you can remember.  Of course, being only ten years
    old, that is not all that long.

    Spring has finally arrived after a cold winter.  The pass leading
    out of the village's valley is still blocked with snow, but in the
    valley itself grass is growing and the days are warmer.

    You are a small boy named Timmy.  You are supposed to be helping
    your father, the village smith, in the forge.  You have no such
    plans!  The sun is shining too brightly to waste the day in a
    dimly lit forge.

    Exploring the spooky forest to the north seems like a lot more
    fun.

exit::Timmy
    Uh oh...  The exit is out of reach!  If only you were taller,
    you'd be able to get out easily!

    Maybe there is another exit from this cave farther in?

fire::Timmy
    Your mother would never let you out of the house again if you hit
    someone with your sling shot!

found::Timmy
    What is that horrible creature?  A horrible undead version of yourself?
    How is that possible...?

tlosh::Timmy
    Oh, what do we have here?  A little human child!  I have not made 
    a child sized zombie in a while.  Why do I not start with you?

win::Timmy
    As the Lich Tlosh falls to the ground, his minions collapse as well.
    With little opposition, you are able to get back to the cave entrance.
    It is not too long before your mother shows up looking for you and helps
    you climb out.

    At first, the villagers do not believe your stories of the Lich Tlosh,
    but when they venture into the cave and find the now inert horrors
    within, they recognize the truth.

    They are so relieved that you saved the world that no one seems to
    be concerned about you having run away from working on the forge.  If
    only every scrape were so easy to get out of!

welcome::Rodney Baker
    You are Rodney Baker.

    Every winter, the snow falls.  Every winter, the single road out
    of this village is blocked.  Thus, every winter, a large stockpile
    of food is made to last the cold months.

    This is where your worries have come.  As the husband to the
    village's baker, you are in charge of maintaining the food
    storehouse.  Even though the winter was long, careful rationing
    would have seen everyone well fed until the passes cleared and
    outside food could be arranged.

    Yesterday, however, in a routine check of the grain supplies, you
    discovered a grey mould had corrupted the grain!  The village will
    go very hungry if a way to neutralize this mould isn't found...

exit::Rodney Baker
    You consider climbing out of the hole, but then realize you cannot
    face the other villagers without the mushrooms.  You must redeem
    yourself!  You turn back to the darkness of the cave, willing to
    face whatever danger you must.

fire::Rodney Baker
    Seeing someone in the line of your fire, you decide against
    firing.

found::Rodney Baker
    Oh no!  That can't be Timmy, can it?  What has happend to turn him into
    an undead monstrosity?  The elder must be told of this at once!

tlosh::Rodney Baker
    Ah, you came here for the mushrooms, no doubt?

    I hope you enjoyed the delicious mould I infected your grain with!

win::Rodney Baker
    You struggle to the surface, gasping for breath.  The bright sun's rays
    purify the lingering shadow of darkness that seemed to cover you ever
    since you saw Tlosh die.

    The village is now safe.  Not only is the grain supply secured, but
    Tlosh is out of commision.  You hope that Farmer Joe considers this
    to have been a sufficiently difficult quest!

welcome::Debbie Baker
    You are Debbie Baker.

    Life in this town has been good for you.  The locals appreciate
    the fine breads you bake.  While the isolation in the winter can
    be extreme, at least you know your husband does a good job of
    ensuring there is enough food.

    Your husband, Rodney Baker, has gone missing.  The last you spoke
    with him he was seeking a solution to the mysterious grey mould
    that infected the grain stores.  While finding a way to fix the
    grain would be great, you are more interested in finding your
    husband.

exit::Debbie Baker
    You gaze wistfully at the sun shining down the entrance.  The
    brightness of the day is not for you, however.  You must either
    find your husband, or find the mushrooms he disappeared seeking!

fire::Debbie Baker
    It isn't very neighbourly to throw things at people!

found::Debbie Baker
    Aahhh!!!

    That cannot be Timmy, can it?  But I recognize those clothes, if not
    the rotted flesh!  Save us all from these horrors!

    Krall must know what to do!

tlosh::Debbie Baker
    You are here looking for your husband, no doubt?  Do not fear.  You 
    will be with him soon.  In the next world!

    Muhahahaha!

win::Debbie Baker
    You have saved the village from Tlosh's evil, but you are still not happy. 
    What use is saving the village if you could not save your husband?

    Still, life must go on.  You use the reward money from the King to travel
    to another village where you won't be haunted by these memories.

welcome::Farmer Amy
    You are Alice Treska.  
    
    To the rest of the world, you are referred
    to in awe as Treska of the Seven Alphabets.  To this small
    mountain-top community, however, you are known as Farmer Amy.

    For the last five years you have been performing an ethnographic
    study of the inhabitants.  By blending yourself in as one of the
    locals, you hope to better understand the average human.  Only
    then will you have the wisdom to guide them!

    Your studies look like they will have to be put on hold.  The
    disappearance of the village's bakers must be investigated.

exit::Farmer Amy
    The mystery of the disappearing Bakers not being yet resolved to
    your satisfaction, and the lack of curative mushrooms not yet
    having been gathered, you are unwilling to contemplate a return to
    the surface just yet.  Further explorations is called for!

fire::Farmer Amy
    Studies of group dynamics have shown that engaging in pointless
    violence is detrimental to all.

found::Farmer Amy
    Odd...  That zombie looks like the village boy Timmy.  It would thus
    seem that someone hereabouts is engaged in the vile art of necromancy.
    I should probably inform the Elder and allow him to deal with whatever
    evil is behind this.  I must maintain the illusion I am but a simple
    farmer, after all.

tlosh::Farmer Amy
    So, Treska of the Seven Alphabets!  We meet again!

    This time you will not escape!  Grovel for me, and I may agree to leave
    your corpse to rest in peace.

win::Farmer Amy
    Ha!  That Tlosh proved no match for your skilled magics.

    This shall be a fun tale to tell when you return to the capital.  In the
    meantime, you need to come up with a convincing explanation of why a simple
    farmer was able to best the dread Lich Tlosh...

welcome::Farmer Joe
    You are Farmer Joe.  
    
    You grew up in this village, and you'll be
    damned before someone's carelessness costs you your food supply.
    People all get themselves up and lost?  Well - you can find them!
    You and your trusty shotgun, that is.

    First, a couple sips of the ole liquid courage.  That's it.  Time
    to kick some ass!

exit::Farmer Joe
    What?  Quit now?  Why not?  What do you owe them - a fool could
    get their neck broke in this dark dungeon...

    *sip*

    Nevermind that cowardly talk.  These critters haven't seen the
    half of good ole Joe yet!

fire::Farmer Joe
    You may be almost blind drunk, but that doesn't make you
    irresponsible!  Well, at least not *that* irresponsible.

found::Farmer Joe
    What?  That is a sight to sober me up!  I cannot believe it - poor Timmy
    - transformed into a zombie?  Is this the fate that awaits us all?

    I had better get the Elder involved - he's got more firepower than I do.

tlosh::Farmer Joe
    I am looking forward to embalming your corpse.  With all that you
    have drunk, I believe I can save a bundle on embalming fluids.

    Now do be so kind as to die in mostly one piece?

win::Farmer Joe
    As you step over Tlosh's smouldering corpse, you reflect on the wisdom
    of sobriety.  Maybe if you had not been drinking, you would have seen
    village person after village person disappear into this hell hole
    to never return?

    Maybe if you acted sooner, fewer lives would have been lost?

    In any case, it isn't every day you get to kill a lich.  That certainly
    calls for a drink!

welcome::Eliza Smith
    You are Eliza Smith, the wife of the village smith.

    Your son, Timmy, has been missing for a considerable time.  At
    first, you discounted it as him shirking his duties.  It would not
    be the first time he'd rather play in the forest than help his
    father stoke the fire.  Still, the days are still short, and the
    woods not a safe place to be at night.

    You have made up your mind.  You must leave your chores aside and
    find Timmy.

exit::Eliza Smith
    You look at the bright sun filtered through the bracken strewn
    cover of the cave.  Such pleasures, you solemnly vow, will not be
    yours until you have found the whereabouts of your lost son,
    Timmy.

fire::Eliza Smith
    It would set a poor example to the children if adults are seen
    throwing things at each other.

found::Eliza Smith
    Noooo!  Not my son!

    What cruel world could do this?  It is bad enough to learn he is dead,
    but to see him ambling about in some horrific semblence of life?

    This is more than I can bear!

tlosh::Eliza Smith
    Ah, the maternal instinct runs strong, bringing you into my cave after
    your lost son.  Do not worry, your son is quite fine.  He makes quite
    the nice zombie specimen, if I do say so for myself.

win::Eliza Smith
    It is with a cold heart you return to the surface world.  Vengence does
    not bring back the loved ones that one has lost.  Why must good people
    die to stop evil?

welcome::Kor Smith
    You are Kor Smith, the village smith.

    Your son, Timmy, has been missing for much too long.  Your wife
    went off looking for him, but has not returned.  You feel bad
    because it should have been you that went looking.  Is that not a
    father's duty?

    You, however, have a fear of rats, and just knew Timmy would be
    playing somewhere that they are plentiful.

    You put down your forgework and brace yourself.  You *will* find
    Timmy.  What sort of father would abandon his son in face of rats?

    Maybe Elder Krall will have some idea what to do?

exit::Kor Smith
    You gaze longingly at the exit.  A beautiful, rat free, world lies
    out there.  But!  It is not for you!

    You will find Timmy or die in the attempt.  No mere rat will stop
    you.

fire::Kor Smith
    Your father taught you never to aim weapons at people, and you
    hope to teach that to your son.  The best way to teach is by
    example

found::Kor Smith
    Timmy?  Is that you?

    What happened?

    What force did this thing to you?

    I must contact the elder at once!

tlosh::Kor Smith
    I am a powerful necromancer, and you are but a village blacksmith who is
    afraid of rats.  Why then should I be afraid of you?

    Come!  Do your worst!

win::Kor Smith
    The mangled corpse of Tlosh lies at your feet.  You breathe heavily,
    scanning about for more combatants.  The other undead seem to have
    lost whatever evil force drove them - they lie now in immobile heaps.

    The village elder must be told about this evil Lich!

welcome::Elder Krall
    You are the Village Elder, Krall.  
    
    You have always taken your role
    as the Village Elder seriously.  When you realized the task would
    fall on you, you went to the Capital to learn what the previous
    Elder could not teach.

    This latest problem may be beyond your skills, however.  What
    seemed to be a simple fungal infection of the grain stores seems
    to instead have been a deliberate subterfuge!  Some evil force
    wanted to lead the townspeople into the forest cave and your best
    intentions led you to be their pawn.

    This evil must be defeated.  If it is allowed to fester until the
    passes clear, it could grow too powerful to be contained.

exit::Elder Krall
    The surface world does not interest you until you have eliminated
    the source of evil.  The first merchants of summer must not fall
    into the hands of this cruel force.

fire::Elder Krall
    You do not need to be an Elder to know that casting spells at
    people is wrong.

found::Elder Krall
    This is bad as I fear.  The evil necromancer has raised poor Timmy
    into a horrible blasphemy of life.  I shall avenge you, Timmy!

tlosh::Elder Krall
    So, Krall, you at least venture into the cave seeking the evil that lurks.
    Seek no farther, for you have found it: I, Tlosh the Lich, shall soon
    conquer the world.

    And all that stands in my way is you.  It is fortunate for me that you
    are such a weakling.

win::Elder Krall
    At last, the evil of the cave has been vanquished!

    Life, or what remains of it, can return to normal in the mountaintop
    village.  You hope the King will forgive you for the losses that
    your village sustained.

    If only you had realized sooner the evil that had lurked.  If only you
    had not played the puppet of Tlosh and led people to his cave!

    Ah, regrets are easy to come by.  Victory is harder.  One must savour it
    when one can.

# Chat commands have the format:
# chat::talker::talkee

chat::Timmy::Kor Smith
    Ah, there you are boy!  Help me stoke this fire!

chat::Timmy::Eliza Smith
    Your father is at the forge waiting for you!  Stop dawdling and
    help him!

chat::Timmy::Debbie Baker
    Sorry Timmy, no cookies yet!  We have to wait for the pass to
    clear first.

chat::Timmy::Rodney Baker
    *Rodney looks worried*

    Timmy?  Don't worry.  Everything will work out.  Not that there is
    anything wrong!

chat::Timmy::Farmer Amy
    Remember Tim, snow in winter means water in spring!  The grain
    should have enough water for a good harvest this summer.  However,
    be careful around the streams!  We never know when there may be a
    flash flood.

chat::Timmy::Farmer Joe
    D'ya reckon we'll have a scorcher like last summer?  After this
    winter, I'd certainly like some heat.  Hey!  Careful where yar
    stepping!  I just mulched that area.

chat::Timmy::Elder Krall
    Ah, Timmy...  Are you not supposed to be at the forge today?

chat::Rodney Baker::Timmy
    *Timmy looks more dirty than usual, if that is possible*

    Mr. Baker?  Whatever you do, keep out of the forest!

chat::Rodney Baker::Debbie Baker
    Perhaps the Elder would know something of this mould?  I certainly
    have never heard of the like before.  And I certainly can't use
    the grain as is!

chat::Rodney Baker::Farmer Joe
    Ya say the grain be ruined?  The grain I grew with my own blood
    and tears?  Why, I wonder why I stockpile the grain with you in
    the first place.

chat::Rodney Baker::Farmer Amy
    This is most tragic news!  Do not blame yourself.  I know you have
    been most careful in keeping the grain dry.  We must get to the
    bottom of this, however.  While I'm sure we can survive this
    season on short rations, imagine if this blight had struck
    earlier?

chat::Rodney Baker::Kor Smith
    By the anvil, Rod!  Surely you know by now that I stick to my
    craft?  I know steel, you know grain.

    Have you seen my boy, however?  He was supposed to help me stoke
    the fire.  I suspect he's off playing somewhere - if you find him,
    send him back post haste!

chat::Rodney Baker::Eliza Smith
    Forget the grain!  Have you seen Timmy?  I'm beginning to worry
    about him...  I know he's run off before, but this feels different
    somehow...

chat::Rodney Baker::Elder Krall
    *Krall takes a sample of the grain and tastes it*

    Urk!

    That is vile!  I have heard of this dread mould.  It is the
    infamous Bile Mould whose bitter taste offends all but the most
    insensitive palate.  
    
    Fortunately, I believe a local mushroom exists that will
    neutralize the taste.  Try looking in the cave in the forest to
    the north - I remember seeing them there.  The mushroom has a pure
    purple cap with smooth white stalk.  
    
    If you can find five of them, we should have enough to restore our
    remaining grain supplies.

chat::Debbie Baker::Timmy
    The forest!  No!  Not the forest!  ARGHH!

chat::Debbie Baker::Rodney Baker
    I'm a zombie!  I'll eat your braaaiinnss!!

chat::Debbie Baker::Kor Smith
    Old Rod?  Yah, I've seen him moping about looking for a solutin to
    that grain business.  I figure the Elder would know more than I.
    I've been working in the forge.  Likely be working all day if
    Timmy doesn't show up soon.

chat::Debbie Baker::Eliza Smith
    Rodney never came back from his search?  Very worrying.  Timmy is
    also missing.  I hope they are both all right.

chat::Debbie Baker::Farmer Joe
    It surprises me not that Rod got himself lost.  Fool ruins the
    grain and then expects us to go pulling him out of his jam?  I'll
    be sitting here with my bottle.

    *hic*

chat::Debbie Baker::Farmer Amy
    I think Rodney took the loss of the grain very personally.  He no
    doubt won't return until he finds whatever will fix the problem.
    You should bring him back before it gets dark.

chat::Debbie Baker::Elder Krall
    Why, yes, Rodney did tell me of the mould.  It is the vicous Bile
    Mould, but fortunately easily neutralized with a local mushroom.

    I sent him to the northern woods to fetch five of the mushrooms.
    You will likely find him in the caves there.

chat::Farmer Amy::Timmy
    Forest.... Forresst!!!  FOORREESTT!

chat::Farmer Amy::Rodney Baker
    I'm dead!  Leave me alone!

chat::Farmer Amy::Debbie Baker
    I know your secret.  You created the headlesses, didn't you?  And
    you are here, not to study, but atone!  It's a good thing this
    story is out of canon, or my leak would be a big problem.

chat::Farmer Amy::Farmer Joe
       *hic*
     So both the bakers have up and vanished, eh?  
       *hic*
     I think I'll just up and vanish this here bottle.   

chat::Farmer Amy::Kor Smith
    Why, hello ma'am!  It is nice to see you here in town.  Odd
    business the Baker's vanishing like that?

    I'd go ask the Elder whats-what, but I have iron working to do.

chat::Farmer Amy::Eliza Smith
    Can no one in this village keep still?  The days are not so long
    yet that people should be going for such long walks.

    Timmy still hasn't returned.  Drag him back by the ear if you see
    him!

chat::Farmer Amy::Elder Krall
    Both of the Baker's went off to look for the mushrooms in the
    forest to the north.  They should be there looking, I'd suspect
    they just haven't found any yet.

    The mushrooms have purple tops and smooth white stalks.  Bring
    back five if you can.

chat::Farmer Joe::Timmy
    Hey Mr. Joe?  Can I have some of that sweet space juice you be
    drinking?

chat::Farmer Joe::Rodney Baker
    You're juiced up again Joe?  Be careful where you aim that shotgun
    your you're liable to kill someone again.

chat::Farmer Joe::Debbie Baker
    If I weren't dead and turned into a zombie, I'd be worried about a
    drunk waving a shotgun around.

chat::Farmer Joe::Farmer Amy
    I find it most curious how you are able to successfully grow food
    every year despite being a good for nothing wretch?  Does this
    mean good for nothing wretches have a place in society?  How
    peculiar...  I must think on this.

chat::Farmer Joe::Kor Smith
    Blimey, Joe, keep well back from the fire!  Your breath is liable
    to ignite!

    Go see the Elder, he'll know the solution to this.

chat::Farmer Joe::Eliza Smith
    Keep away from my house until you sober up!  The example you set!
    Have you no sense of shame?

chat::Farmer Joe::Elder Krall
    Indeed, I see.  It is to the woods to the north that you should
    go.  No!  North is the other way!

chat::Eliza Smith::Timmy
    Mother!  It was so scary...  I went into the woods, where I wasn't
    supposed to.  Then I died, 'cause the game designer is evil and
    didn't make it possible for me to live, no matter how hard I
    fought!

    Why would he do that?  Why?

chat::Eliza Smith::Rodney Baker
    Timmy?  No, I didn't see any sign of him.  I didn't explore all of
    the cave though, just enough to find the mushrooms we needed.

chat::Eliza Smith::Debbie Baker
    Ach, how you must worry!  Timmy is such a sweet child.  I trust he
    is quite fine.  Likely got himself lost in the forest and be glad
    to see you.  Fortunately, us being bounded by mountains and all,
    he can't have gone far.

chat::Eliza Smith::Farmer Amy
    Why, I understand full well the maternal concerns over a lost
    child.  I have long studied such issues.  The world would be
    better if the love of a mother for a child could be somehow
    distilled and applied as a potion to the temperments of those
    ill-favoured morally.

    I know Timmy often plays in the woods north of here.  I would
    suggest looking there.

chat::Eliza Smith::Farmer Joe
    Why, Timmy?  He no doubt is hiding from the likes of you!  Knows
    you are to put him to work, I wager!  Can't say I blame the lad.
    I'd hide if I knew someone was seeking to lock me up in a forge
    all day!

    Go back to your home and relax.  I'm sure he'll be back by
    nightfall.

chat::Eliza Smith::Kor Smith
    No, Timmy ran off as soon as he thought I noticed him.  Maybe the
    elder...

    ...

    What?  Stop crying to the Elder for everything?

    ...

    No, it is *not* because I'm afraid of rats!

    ...

    Very well - you find the danged boy!

chat::Eliza Smith::Elder Krall
    Ah, the wildness of youth!  I'm sure Timmy is just climbing the
    trees in the woods.  It is a fine day, after all.    

chat::Kor Smith::Timmy
    Ah, father!  I am so sorry I forced you to venture into a rat
    infested cave!

    If only the player playing me was not so incompetent as to get me
    killed!  I could have beaten that lich!  Why did I have to die?
    Why!

chat::Kor Smith::Rodney Baker
    What a surprise!  Kor out of the forge!

    I last saw your wife heading into the woods.  I suspect she is
    still searching there, as I have not seen her return.  I didn't
    see him in my mushroom quest, but it was a big cave.  Be careful,
    I saw RATS there!

    Ha!  What a reaction!

chat::Kor Smith::Debbie Baker
    Ah, poor Timmy!  I'd go help, but I'm busy with the grain.  The
    village has to eat, after all.

chat::Kor Smith::Farmer Amy
    Truly it is worrying that Timmy has not returned.  I tend to
    resort to quiet contemplation to resolve these sorts of problems.
    I can understand that you'd be a man of action, however!  Working
    with metal must teach you to strike fast and without hesitation.

    Let me not delay you any longer.

chat::Kor Smith::Farmer Joe
    What ya bothering me for?  Surely your precious village elder can
    set things straight?  Or has Krall gone senile since you last
    spouted his praises?

chat::Kor Smith::Eliza Smith
    Why you blasted good for nothing husband!  Letting me go off and
    be zombiefied!  I hope you at least got over your fear of rats.

    (Editors Note: Don't expect text which is never said to make
    sense.)

chat::Kor Smith::Elder Krall
    Kor, my dear child!  You really must start to think for yourself.
    No need to come to me for every question.  And no need to send the
    townspeople after me with every problem!  Think: Where was your
    wife going when you last saw here?

    Aha, there you go - the answer - and requiring not my aid!

chat::Elder Krall::Timmy
    Is it true you have a secret love triangle with Debbie Baker and
    Farmer Amy?

chat::Elder Krall::Rodney Baker
    Thank you for pointing me in the direction of those mushrooms!
    The grain is saved.  Hopefully Farmer Joe will still be willing to
    store grain communally again next year...

chat::Elder Krall::Debbie Baker
    Those mushrooms did the trick, Elder!  The bread baked from the
    purified grain has no trace of that horrid taste.

chat::Elder Krall::Farmer Amy
    Me just simple farmer.  Me no comprehend your wise words.

chat::Elder Krall::Farmer Joe
    Ah, Krall, good to see ya come by!  The cider from last summer has
    hardened nicely, if I don't say so for myself!  We must sit back
    and sip it one of these days...

chat::Elder Krall::Eliza Smith
    Please, elder!  What has happened is too horrible for words.  I
    cannot sleep thinking of what has happend to poor Timmy...

chat::Elder Krall::Kor Smith
    These are dark times, Elder.  I look to you for guidance as to
    what we should do?

    With your death the hopes of the village have ended.  When the
    snowy pass clears in the summer, the first traders will have a
    grisly sight.  Another mountain top village has turned into a
    ghost town.  Too late will the King realize the threat that this
    entails.  Soon the Lich Tlosh will rule the entire world!

    Better luck with your next village!
