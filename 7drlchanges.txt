This documents the changes done since the Seven Day Roguelike
Challenge.

These changes are designed to increase interoperability and fix bugs,
rather than expand the game in any way.  The game is, of course, done.

- New AI type "Stay Home" which stays still if the mob is already at home.
  This is used by Kor Smith so he doesn't leave the forge, but can still get
  off the down staircase when you escape with him.
- Curses support with gfx_curses.cpp & gfx_curses.h.
- Documented 5, ., >, and < keys.
- Fixed the number pad under Windows XP.  It should now work again.
- After saving the game and reloading, you can still escape from the dungeon.
- Fix the bitmap loading to not depend on endianness or packing issues.
- Added more diagnostic messages for SDL failures.
- Renamed MSVC solution to liveonce from winport.
