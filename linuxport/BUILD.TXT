Good luck building this!

First, build enummaker from support/enummaker.  This should just be a matter
of make.

Then put enummaker in your path

Next, run the premake from this directory:
make premake

This builds the glbdef.cpp and glbdef.h files.

Now, build the actual app with make from this directory.

Finally, copy into the final location these files:
text.txt
valley.map
piecelist.map
alphabet.bmp
liveonce

When these are all in the same directory, you can run it with ./liveonce!

This is set up to build the SDL version.  To build the curses version,
remove the line
#define USE_SDL
from gfxengine.cpp
