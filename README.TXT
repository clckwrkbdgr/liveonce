Welcome to You Only Live Once!

This is a Seven Day Roguelike.  It was written in a 168 hour time
frame.  Hopefully it doesn't feel like that was the case, however.

You Only Live Once is written by Jeff Lait and uses SDL for graphical
output.

If you are a windows users, run it from windows/liveonce.exe.

If you are a linux user, try:
cd linux
./liveonce

If you are a source diver, go into the src directory and know much
fear.  Look for BUILD.TXT files to try and guide you.

If you don't like the default font, you can change it!

Go to your executable directory and note the file alphabet.bmp.  Go to
src/gfx/alphabet.txt and display that text.  Take a screen capture,
crop the relevant area, and save as a .bmp.  Overwrite your executable
directory's version of alphabet.bmp, and the new font should be
running!

Have fun!
