Executive Summary
-----------------

There is no warranty, etc, with the code, executables, images, etc.
Use at your own risk.

Feel free to make derivative works using LiveOnce as the base.  Feel
free to redistribute such works as you please.  Feel free to grab the
algorithms presented here and use them in your unrelated code.

Feel free to enjoy playing the game!

Note that if you wish to redistribute binary versions AND wish to
redistribute SDL.DLL, you must redistribute the SDL.DLL source code.
If you do not redistribute SDL.DLL, ignore this paragraph.

Details
-------

MSVCP71.DLL and MSVCR71.DLL are owned and licensed entirely by
Microsoft.  They are redistributed with liveonce as per their edicts.
I'd rather not have to include them.

The alphabet*.bmp are screen captures of standard fonts, so likely
have some icky licensing issues I do not understand.

Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library is licensed under the GNU
Lesser General Public License (LGPL)

------------ SDL LICENCE -------------
Licensing the Simple DirectMedia Layer library

The Simple DirectMedia Layer library is currently available under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2 or newer. This
license allows you to link with the library in such a way that users
can modify the library and have your application use the new version. 

The GNU LGPL license can be found online at:
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html 

To comply with this license, you must give prominent notice that you
use the Simple DirectMedia Layer library, and that it is included
under the terms of the LGPL license. You must include a copy of the
LGPL license. You must also do one of the following: 

1. Include the source code for the version of SDL that you link with,
as well as the full source or object code to your application so that
the user can relink your application, or 

2. Include a written offer, valid for at least three years, to provide
the materials listed in option 1, charging no more than the cost of
providing this distribution, or 

3. Make the materials listed in option 1 available from the same place
that your application is available. 

The most common way to comply with the license is to dynamically link
with SDL, and then include the SDL source code and appropriate notices
with your application. 

Embedded Use: Personally, I don't have a problem with anybody
statically linking SDL for use with embedded environments that don't
already have an open development environment. (i.e. the users can't
relink programs anyway) However, this does technically violate the
LGPL, so be cautioned. 
------------ End SDL LICENE ----------

If this is a binary distribution and I have include SDL.DLL,
understand I am complying with option #3.  The source code for 
SDL is packaged with the source code for You Only Live Once, which you
can find at http://www.zincland.com/7drl/liveonce/.

In any case, you are recommended to get the latest source directly
from the SDL website as this version may be out of date.

If you want to use the excellent Mersenne Twister elsewhere, you are
strongly recommended to get a new version from the official
site rather than extracting this version, as this one may be out of
date.
